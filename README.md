## Introduction

Thank you for visiting the DVD Rental Dataset Analysis project. This project is a starting point for an in-depth review of a dynamic dataset representing the activities of a DVD rental business. It provides an extensive set of tables covering films, actors, customers, rentals, and other topics. This is a great resource if you're looking to gain hands-on experience with SQL and data analysis.

## Tool
- PostgreSQL (Version: 16.3)
